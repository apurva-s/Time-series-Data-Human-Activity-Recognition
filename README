Team 28 - ECE 542 - Project C2 Code Submission

In order to run the project you will need the training data, test data,
Data_Prepocessing.ipynb, and Team28_final_code.ipynb

The following libraries were used inside of google collab:
keras, numpy, os, glob, pandas, sklearn, math, collections,scipy,tenserflow

Each .ipynb file has sections to import the necessary libraries to run the code for 
this project.

The code was run using google collab.  

First we need to combine all of the datasets into one larger csv, this is done in the 
Data_Prepocessing.ipynb file. The user must run every line of code in that file.  They 
will also have to specify where the TrainingData is located (only the directory, 
not each individual file). Once every line of code is run, a file named "final.csv" will 
be created and downloaded. This file will then be used in the Team28_final_code.ipynb 
workspace.

In the Team28_final_code.ipynb workspace every line of code must be run with the 
exception of the "Cross Validation" section.  This is not needed to create the predictions.  
Every block of code should be executed in chronological order.  The user must specify a path 
to the "final.csv" file in the "Import Data From CSV" section.  They must also specify a 
path to the prediction datasets in the "Run the predictions for subjects 9 to 12" section.
